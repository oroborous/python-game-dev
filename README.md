# Python Game Development
## 152-111

### Getting Started
This repository contains the three games we will build:

- Demo Ball Pickup
- Space Invaders
- Tower Defense

You will be asked to modify the last two games and submit your modifications for grading. You may work directly in this project, or start a new project and code along from scratch.

The game assets (sound and image files) are included in this project, or are available to download separately from Canvas as ZIP files.

### Required Packages
To install the required packages, you can use the tools that are built into your Python editor of choice, or you can use a Python package installer such as PIP.

If using your IDE, select the following packages and versions. **Please do not install the default/latest versions of these packages.**

- cocos2d, 0.6.9
- pyglet, 1.5.18
- six, 1.16.0

You can also use PIP and the command line to install the packages. This project includes a file named `requirements.txt` that PIP can read to install the correct version of each package.

Open a command prompt and enter the following, making sure to replace `C:\location_of_file` with the correct location of the `requirements.txt` file.

`pip install -r C:\location_of_file\requirements.txt`

If you receive a message that PIP cannot be found, you probably need to add Python to your system path. Follow the instructions for your operating system here: [https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/)

You will need to close and reopen the command prompt after modifying the path.
